This is a build of a chord generation concept done at the Pursuit AI Native Pilot Workshop.
It was "coded", if you can call it that, entirely through natural language conversations with DeepSeek, with minimal manual debugging.
The code is sloppy, and could probably be refined into something nicer -- ex: not having the chords listed as an ordered list, but iterating it dynamically.

TODO: Weighting chords -- nobody needs the VIIÂ° chord as often as javascript's RNG wants to throw.
Choose between defined progressions, weighted random, or the current case of true randomness.
